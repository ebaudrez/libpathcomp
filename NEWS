0.2	2015-04-20	Edward Baudrez <edward.baudrez@gmail.com>

New features:

	* Config file: Added feature to inherit attributes from another section
	using the special attribute name 'copy-from'.

	* pathcomp.h: Added new function pathcomp_clone() to clone an existing
	composer object.

Changes breaking backwards compatibility of API:

	* pathcomp.h: Renamed function pathcomp_reset() to pathcomp_rewind().

	* pathcomp.h: Attributes are no longer rewound automatically after calling
	pathcomp_set() or pathcomp_add().

	* pathcomp.h (pathcomp_mkdir): Inverted the return value. 0 now signifies
	success, and -1 failure.

Other changes:

	* Build: The 'prove' utility is no longer needed to build Libpathcomp.

	* Documentation: The SYNOPSIS has been elaborated a bit to give potential
	users an idea of what the library is for.
